General:
- less general / sentences without meaning -> leave out

Structure:
DONE - change literature review to review
DONE - 1. Risk & return measures incl. log-returns, heavy tails and skewness 2. Distributions 3. Mean-Variance (Markowitz)
- more text for markowitz summary

Review:
DONE - Normal distribution = first cumulative functions etc. then information about quantiles
DONE - Student's distribution = it is not always zero centered
- for all distributions = explain how the tails fall e.g. e^2 or power law, for skew t one tail is exponential one tail is power law
DONE - inverse gaussian before ghyp
DONE - copula, contour plot for t-copula vs. normal copula

Analysis:
- Estimating with bootstrapping parameters
DONE - Vola clustering as own paragraph with own section
DONE - sub sections for thought processes
- Copula show tail correlation by calculating copula by method:
log c = log(f(x,y)) - log(f(x)) - log(f(y))
